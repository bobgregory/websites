## General Info
This was a little project to learn basic HTML, PHP, CSS, & JS.
I got some help from [Pete Gregory](https://github.com/petegregoryy)<br>
The [Boids algorithm](https://github.com/beneater/boids) used on all pages was made by [Ben Eater](https://github.com/beneater)
## Main Page
The main page is just a place you can navigate to all the other pages, it doesn't do alot and has some fade in animations for the buttons 

## Downloads System
The downloads system uses PHP to create a list of file names in a folder, and then create buttons that download that file. The text put in the button has the extension removed.

## Potential Improvements
I intend on completely replacing this website with one that is more round and with a nicer colour scheme.
And to follow HTML5 guidelines using semantic tags etc..
