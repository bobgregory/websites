            <span id="content">So last month I got hit by a car and died right. 
              Which I didn't initially realize until I watched some guy haul my body into his pickup and drive off. 
              Which, being that it's deep in rural Michigan, I assume means my body will make some venison jerky 
              and maybe some wall decoration, and I'll be resigned to being one of hundreds of deer ghosts floating around Saginaw, 
              which is whatever. But then I find out the guy works at a taxidermy shop or something, 
              and he's actually pretty good at stuffing and mounting deer carcasses,  
              which I come to find out when I find myself face to face with my old body in the shop window. 
              So naturally, I figure since ghosts need to possess something to interact with the living world and etc etc etc 
              the most logical thing to do is to possess my own body, since it's basically a statue of myself. 
              And a little surprisingly, it actually fits like a glove. Like, since it's my body, it feels like stepping right back into place. 
              So I get out of town and back to my herd, eventually. And that's where the trouble starts coming into it, 
              because after I get settled again, I don't know how to explain to everyone else what feels so weird. 
              Like since I can move my body and do everything I used to do, it's functionally the same, like nothing happened. 
              Or it SHOULD be, so I don't know how to explain how it's NOT. But it's just hard to explain it to someone who's never been hit by a truck I guess.</span>
